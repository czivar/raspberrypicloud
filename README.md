The Raspberry Pi Cloud
======================

Our intention is to use the Pi to replicate a modern 500 million dollar datacentre in miniature. The cloud is to be used for teaching and research, and enables students to reach "under the hood" of cloud computing and get to grips with the technical details involved in constructing and managing a cloud.

This is my final project at University of Glasgow in 2012/2013.

My supervisors are: 
- Jeremy Singer (University of Glasgow)
- David R. White (University of Glasgow)
- Imre Szeberenyi (Budapest University of Technology and Economics) 

This repository will contain:
- all of the code and architecture of the system
- my dissertation in tex, pdf
- Wiki
