The Raspberry Pi Cloud
======================

Our intention is to use the Pi to replicate a modern 500 million dollar
datacentre in miniature. The cloud is to be used for teaching and research, and
enables students to reach "under the hood" of cloud computing and get to grips
with the technical details involved in constructing and managing a cloud.
